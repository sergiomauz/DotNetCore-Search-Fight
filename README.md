- Application console
- C# programming language
- Google search API
- Bing search API
- Newtonsoft for serializing JSON into C# objects


## Techniques used
- Serializing and Deserializing objects.
- Asynchronous tasks.
- Consuming APIs.
- Use of search engines.
- Use of collections.
- Use of StringBuilders.

- With a Microsoft account, sign in and create an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) Account.
- Go to your [Azure Console](https://portal.azure.com/#home): Create a **Bing Search v7**, copy one of the **Keys** and replace the variable **BING_OCP_APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY** value in the **Constants.cs** file.
- Press **F5** to compile and start the solution.
- In a **Command Prompt** Move to directory **Search.Fight/bin/Debug**.
